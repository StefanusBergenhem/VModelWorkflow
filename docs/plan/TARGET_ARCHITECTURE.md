# Target Architecture

## Vision

A framework for V-model compliant software development, built as three independent pillars that can be used standalone or combined. Supports human-only, agent-only, or mixed development teams.

## Three Pillars

**No pillar depends on the others to function.**

- Pillar 1 alone: human team gets V-model templates and checklists
- Pillar 1 + 2: human team gets templates + automated completeness checking
- Pillar 1 + 2 + 3: full agentic V-model development
- Pillar 3 craft skills alone: someone just wants a good requirement-writing or review prompt

## Pillar 1: V-Model Compliance

### Purpose

Define what artifacts are needed for V-model compliance, their structure, and their relationships. This is the **definitional** layer — it says what things look like, not how to create them or how to check them.

### Components

**Artifact Schemas** — YAML definitions for each V-level artifact type:

Left side (development):
- System Requirements, SW Requirements, Architecture, Detailed Design
- ~~Source Code metadata~~ — replaced by pragmatic approach: source code is real files, linked via Pillar 2 trace files

Right side (verification):
- System Test Cases (YAML artifact — system tests are often manual procedures, demonstrations, or analyses, not executable code)
- ~~Test Specifications, Test Results, Coverage Reports~~ — replaced by pragmatic approach: lower-level tests are real test files (unit, integration, qualification), results are tool output (JUnit XML, gtest XML), coverage is tool output (jacoco, gcov) — all linked via Pillar 2 trace files
- Review Records (separate artifact type, linked via traceability)

Plans:
- Development, Verification, CM, QA

Each schema defines: required fields, optional fields, field types. Schemas do NOT enforce specific content patterns (e.g., EARS is not required by the schema).

**Assurance Level Configuration** — How rigor scales:
- Optional property on artifacts (not universal)
- Defines coverage targets, verification methods, documentation formality per level
- Default behavior is high-rigor (benefits agent output quality)
- Maps to DAL (aviation), ASIL (automotive), or quality levels (ASPICE)

**Translation Layer** — Domain-specific vocabulary:
- Generic V-model terms -> DO-178C terms
- Generic V-model terms -> ASPICE terms
- Applied to reports and exports, not to internal data

**Scaffold Tool** (concept, CLI for later):
- Creates blank artifacts from templates
- Humans can populate artifacts without any agent involvement
- Could be same tool as Pillar 2 engine, or separate lightweight CLI

### Artifact Envelope

Every artifact shares a common envelope. Type-specific content goes in the body:

```yaml
artifact_id: "SWREQ-042"           # human-readable, type-prefixed
artifact_type: "sw-requirement"     # references an artifact schema
version: "1.0.0"
status: "draft"                     # draft | in_review | approved | baselined | superseded
assurance_level: 3                  # OPTIONAL — not all artifact types need this

body:                               # type-specific content
  title: "Fuel rate limiting"
  statement: "..."                  # free text, any format
  rationale: "..."
  verification_method: "test"
```

Fields explicitly NOT in the envelope:
- `created_by` — irrelevant to compliance assessment
- `reviewed_by` — insufficient; review records are separate artifacts
- `trace_up` / `trace_down` — traceability is Pillar 2's concern

### Artifact ID Strategy

Two-tier identification:
- **Human-facing:** `TYPE-nnn` (e.g., `SWREQ-042`) — readable, stable
- **Machine-facing:** content hash appended for change detection (e.g., `SWREQ-042@a3f7c2`)

The hash changes when content changes, enabling automatic staleness detection.

## Pillar 2: Traceability

### Purpose

Link artifacts together, validate completeness, detect gaps. This is the **relational** layer — it manages the graph between artifacts.

### Data Model (Phase A — now)

**Link Schema** — defines how artifacts connect:

```yaml
source: "SWREQ-042"
target: "TS-042-01"
link_type: "verified-by"
status: "draft"
```

Links are:
- **Many-to-many** — a requirement can trace to multiple tests, designs, review records
- **Typed** — each link has a defined type (verified-by, allocated-to, reviewed-in, etc.)
- **Attributed** — links carry their own metadata (status, etc.)
- **Stored separately** — not embedded in artifacts

**Link Type Definitions** — what link types exist and their rules:
- Which artifact types can be source/target for each link type
- Which links are required for completeness at each assurance level
- Bidirectional validation rules

**Validation Rules** — completeness and consistency checks:
- Orphan detection (artifact with no required links)
- Coverage analysis (% of requirements with tests)
- Staleness detection (content hash changed, links not re-validated)
- Bidirectional consistency

### Temporary Agent Skill (Phase A — now)

An agent craft skill that reads YAML artifact and trace files and performs validation. Serves as stand-in until the deterministic engine is built. Good enough to get started and validate the data model.

### Deterministic Engine (Phase B — later)

A CLI tool:
- Written in a fast, portable language
- Reads YAML artifacts and trace files
- Validates completeness, detects gaps, produces reports
- Runs in CI/CD pipelines
- No AI dependency — purely deterministic

### Web GUI (Phase C — future)

For non-developer stakeholders:
- View and edit documentation artifacts
- Input flows into the repo via defined process

## Pillar 3: Agentic Skills

### Purpose

Skills, agents, and commands that guide AI to produce quality V-model artifacts. Built as standard Claude Code skills following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open spec, using the `/skill-creator` plugin for development and evaluation.

> Research: `research/pillar3/` — covers agents vs skills vs commands, HumanLayer workflow patterns, HITL integration, skill composition, LLM-tier compatibility, and existing libraries.

### Three Layers (bottom-up, no orchestration until proven)

```

(pure domain knowledge)        (framework-aware)                   (existing codebase)

  ~/.claude/skills/ (global)    .claude/skills/ (project)          .claude/skills/ (project)
```

### Layer 1: Craft Skills (current focus)

Each craft skill follows the agentskills.io / mgechev best practices format:

```
skills/craft/write-requirement/
├── SKILL.md              # < 500 lines, frontmatter + procedures
├── scripts/              # Deterministic validation helpers
├── references/           # Flat: EARS templates, quality checklists
└── assets/               # Output templates, examples
```

Properties:
- **One responsibility** (write a requirement, review a design, characterize code)
- **No framework knowledge** (doesn't know about our YAML schemas or trace model)
- **Independently usable** — someone can use just this skill outside DoWorkflow
- **Third-person imperative** instructions, step-by-step numbered procedures
- **Progressive disclosure** — SKILL.md is navigation, references loaded JiT
- **Deterministic scripts** for fragile/repetitive operations
- **Evaluated** using skill-creator's eval framework (test prompts, assertions, benchmarks)

Skill categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Requirements | Requirement writing (EARS), requirement review, decomposition |
| Design | Architecture design, detailed design, design review |
| Verification | Test case writing, test review, coverage interpretation |
| Implementation | Implement from tests, refactor, code review |
| Analysis | Code structure analysis, behavior characterization, change impact |

EARS is a preference of our craft skills, not a framework requirement.

### Layer 2: Pillar 1+2 Integration (future)

Thin skills that bridge craft output to our framework:
- **Output templates** from Pillar 1 artifact schemas (YAML templates an agent fills in)
- **Framework context** (how to use schemas, what trace links to create)
- **Pillar 2 scripts** (validation helpers that check schema compliance, link completeness)

These skills call or compose with Layer 1 craft skills but add framework awareness.

### Layer 3: Repo Investigation (future)

Skills and agents for creating artifacts in existing codebases (the pilot):
- **Codebase analysis agents** — inspired by HumanLayer's read-only specialized agents (codebase-locator, codebase-analyzer pattern)
- **Artifact bootstrapping** — extract implicit requirements from code
- **Gap analysis** — what's missing, what needs formalization
- **Handoff documents** — cross-session continuity for large analysis work

### Orchestration (deferred)

Orchestration pipelines (DRTDD, scan, report) are deferred until individual craft skills are proven in practice. Will revisit when Layer 1 skills are stable and evaluated.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Three Independent Pillars

No cross-pillar dependencies where not strictly needed. A craft skill references Pillar 1 schemas via `schema_ref` for its contracts, but the schemas don't know about skills. The traceability engine reads artifacts defined by Pillar 1 schemas, but the schemas don't know about the engine.

### 2. YAML for All Machine-Readable Data

Human-readable, git-diffable, easy for both humans and agents to produce.

### 3. Artifacts Live Alongside Code

In the target repository, version-controlled, diffable, PR-reviewable.

### 4. Deterministic Where Possible

Traceability validation is a tool concern, not an agent concern. Coverage checking is deterministic. Schema validation is deterministic. Agents create, tools verify.

### 5. Incremental by Design

Everything works on subsets: module-by-module, requirement-by-requirement.

### 6. Generic V-Model + Translation

Internal terms are generic. Domain-specific vocabulary applied via translation layer for reports and exports.

## Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Independence** | Each pillar usable standalone; no forced AI dependency |
| **Portability** | Language-agnostic schemas; language-specific adapters |
| **Extensibility** | New skills, translations, artifact types without changing existing |
| **Reliability** | Deterministic tools for validation; agents for creative work |
| **Usability** | Works for human-only, agent-only, or mixed teams |
| **Maintainability** | YAML schemas are self-documenting; skills are self-contained |
| **Testability** | Skills evaluated via skill-creator (test prompts, assertions, benchmarks); engine has deterministic expected outputs |
| **Composability** | Small craft skills, independently usable; orchestration deferred until proven |
| **Portability** | agentskills.io open standard; skills usable in other tools (Cursor, Codex CLI) |
