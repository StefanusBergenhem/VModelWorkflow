# Backlog

Organized by component. Build order is bottom-up: start from the lowest V-model layer (code + unit tests) and work upward through each layer, completing documentation → template → craft skill → framework skill for each layer before moving to the next.

## Open Questions

Questions identified during architecture refinement (2026-04-05) that need resolution as we encounter them:

1. **Handoff artifact format:** The research/plan phase produces an "implementation contract" for the agent-orchestrated loop. What fields does this contract contain? Similar to current_task.yaml but richer — needs design decisions, rationale, scope boundaries from the discussion.

2. **Code-level research/plan:** Should the lowest level (code implementation) have a lightweight research/plan step for implementation strategy (e.g., "token bucket vs sliding window"), or is the detailed design sufficient input? Current position: probably a brief "read design, confirm approach" step within develop-code, not a separate skill.

3. **Legacy RE skill boundaries:** Legacy reverse-engineering is a use case combining analysis craft skills + templates + traceability. What specific analysis skills are needed? (Code structure analysis, behavior characterization, requirement inference, gap detection.) How do they differ from forward-engineering craft skills?

4. **Orchestration commonality:** Each V-model layer gets its own implementation loop initially. After building 3-4 layers, what patterns emerge? When do we refactor to shared orchestration?

5. **Documentation format:** ~~RESOLVED (2026-04-05).~~ Per-artifact documentation is HTML pages in `docs/guide/artifacts/`. Three-tier knowledge system: research (raw sources) → HTML docs (refined, single source of truth) → agent skills (LLM-distilled). No markdown intermediate layer — absorbed into HTML and deleted.

6. **Test environment argumentation:** Host/target-like/target test environment selection and justification. Deferred until system test work begins.

## Component 3: Documentation

Single source of truth. AI skills are derived from this. Per-artifact documentation must be complete before the corresponding skill is developed.

### Documentation Structure Per Artifact Type

Each artifact type gets a comprehensive HTML page (`docs/guide/artifacts/<artifact>.html`) covering:
1. What it is (V-model independent introduction)
2. V-model context (where it fits, why, standards perspective)
3. Producing a quality workproduct (the bulk — V-model independent, craft-level)
   - Best practices, patterns/anti-patterns, quality metrics, examples for every principle
4. V-model specific considerations (if any additional V-model gotchas)
5. Framework integration (our templates, schemas, traceability)
6. AI skills integration (future — how agent skills relate)

Priority: quality workproduct first, V-model fit second.

## Component 4: AI Skills

> **Architecture design document:** [`docs/guide/skills-architecture.html`](../guide/skills-architecture.html) — defines all skills, agents, orchestration, contracts, config, and file layout. This backlog tracks what to build and in what order; the architecture doc defines what each component is.

Three-layer architecture: Layer 1 (craft + framework skills) → Layer 2 (agents) → Layer 3 (orchestration). All components use `vmodel-skill-*` / `vmodel-agent-*` naming. Vendor-neutral model tiers (Tier 1 Reasoning / Tier 2 Workhorse / Tier 3 Fast).

### Skill Foundation

- [x] Define craft skill contract schema (design-time reference)
- [x] Define orchestration pipeline contract schema (design-time reference)
- [x] Skills architecture designed (`docs/guide/skills-architecture.html`, 2026-04-06)
- [ ] Reconcile `schemas/core/craft-skill.schema.yaml` with agentskills.io SKILL.md format
- [ ] Finalize `.vmodel/config.yaml` schema (Phase A2)

---

### Lower V Skill Build Plan (Detailed Design + Code + Unit Tests)

Structured as six phases. Each phase lists tasks, context to load, and inputs needed.

#### Phase A: Foundation (reference files, config schema, eval scenarios)

Everything downstream depends on this phase. The reference `.md` files are the distilled knowledge that skills point to. Eval scenarios are needed to test every skill.

**A1. Extract/update shared reference files from documentation**

Audit existing reference files against the comprehensive documentation, then create missing ones.

| Reference File | Status | Source Documentation | Gap Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code-quality-checks.md` | EXISTS — needs audit | `docs/guide/artifacts/source-code.html` §3 | Existing file covers functions, error handling, naming, architecture, dead code. May be missing: design patterns guidance, immutability depth, AI-specific pitfalls from §3.4 |
| `testing-anti-patterns.md` | EXISTS — needs audit | `docs/guide/artifacts/unit-test.html` §3.5, §3.7 | Existing file has 6 anti-patterns + self-check. Documentation adds 8 test smells (fragile, obscure, eager, mystery guest, general fixture, conditional logic, erratic, slow) + AI failure modes (tautological, assertion-free, happy-path bias, over-mocking, hallucinated assertions, copy-paste). Significant gap. |
| `derivation-strategies.md` | EXISTS — needs audit | `docs/guide/artifacts/unit-test.html` §3.2 | Existing file covers all 4 strategies. Check if decision table method for compound conditions and coverage matrix format need updating. |
| `design-quality-criteria.md` | NEW | `docs/guide/artifacts/detailed-design.html` §3.1-§3.6 | Interface completeness (DbC), behavioral specification (decision tables, state machines), rationale requirements, error handling design, dynamic behavior/concurrency |
| `review-checklist-code.md` | NEW | `docs/guide/artifacts/source-code.html` §3.5 + `unit-test.html` §3.5 | Combined code + test review. Three sections: code quality, test quality, cross-checks |
| `review-checklist-dd.md` | NEW | `docs/guide/artifacts/detailed-design.html` §3 all | Interface completeness, behavioral specification, rationale, error handling, testability |
| `retrofit-risks.md` | NEW | `docs/guide/artifacts/detailed-design.html` §3.8 | Post-hoc rationalization, code paraphrase trap, missing intent, human involvement triggers |

Context to load:
- `docs/guide/artifacts/source-code.html` (all of §3)
- `docs/guide/artifacts/unit-test.html` (all of §3)
- `docs/guide/artifacts/detailed-design.html` (all of §3)
- Existing reference files: `.claude/skills/develop-code/references/code-quality-checks.md`, `.claude/skills/derive-test-cases/references/testing-anti-patterns.md`, `.claude/skills/derive-test-cases/references/derivation-strategies.md`

**A2. Finalize `.vmodel/config.yaml` schema**

Define the project configuration schema per the architecture doc (§Configuration). Needed before `vmodel-skill-tool-checks` can be written.

Context to load:
- `docs/guide/skills-architecture.html` §Configuration section

**A3. Create/update eval scenarios**

Existing evals: fuel-rate-limiter, message-parser, temperature-controller, session-manager-L1. These test code generation and test derivation from design docs.

New eval scenarios needed:
- [ ] **Design-level scenarios** (for develop-dd, retrofit-dd, review-dd): component with requirements/architecture as input (forward), existing code as input (retrofit)
- [ ] **Adversarial review scenarios** (for review-code, review-dd): deliberately flawed code/designs with known defects planted — test whether the reviewer catches them
- [ ] **Review existing code+test evals**: verify they still test the delta that matters after reference file updates
- [ ] **Cross-language coverage**: existing evals cover Java, Python, Go. Check if this is sufficient.

Context to load:
- `.claude/skills/derive-test-cases/evals/` (existing evals and design files)
- `.claude/skills/develop-code/evals/` (existing evals and design files)
- `docs/guide/skills-architecture.html` §Craft Skills (what each skill is supposed to do)

---

## Build Order

Bottom-up, one V-model layer at a time. For each layer: documentation first, then template, then craft skills, then framework skills.

### Phase 1+2: Lowest V-Level Documentation — DONE

```

## Guiding Principles

1. **Documentation is the foundation.** Write the documentation first, derive everything else from it. If we can't explain it in documentation, we can't claim the AI skills will produce compliant output.
2. **Bottom-up build order.** Start from code, work up through each V-model layer. Prove each layer end-to-end.
3. **Components are independent (SOLID).** No forced coupling. But designed to compose.
4. **Individual loops per layer.** Each V-model layer gets its own orchestration. Refactor to shared patterns only after building 3-4 layers.
5. **Human drives, AI executes, human verifies.** Not an autonomous pipeline. Mid-senior engineers orchestrating AI agents.
6. **Deterministic where possible.** Validation is a tool concern, not an agent concern.
7. **EARS is a skill preference, not a framework requirement.**
8. **Discuss before writing.** Explain approach, show visually, motivate, get approval.
9. **Model-tier aware.** Skills must work on cheapest viable tier (Tier 3 Fast). Test with baseline comparison. Vendor-neutral tiers: Tier 1 Reasoning / Tier 2 Workhorse / Tier 3 Fast.
10. **Incremental always.** Module-by-module. Layer-by-layer.
11. **Follow agentskills.io spec.** SKILL.md format, progressive disclosure, scripts for determinism.
12. **Use `/skill-creator` for development.** Draft, test, evaluate, iterate.

## Procedure: Research Before Documentation

Every artifact documentation page (Component 3) requires thorough research before writing. This procedure ensures the documentation is authoritative, sourced, and at the caliber needed to serve as the single source of truth from which AI skills are derived.

### Why This Exists

The unit test documentation (3.2) was initially written from V-model standards research alone. On review, it read like an expanded agent skill — procedural, thin on craft knowledge, organized as workflow steps rather than knowledge domains. The source code documentation (3.1), which had three research documents behind it (standards, clean code best practices, and a synthesis), was significantly deeper. The difference is directly attributable to research depth.

**Rule: documentation quality is bounded by research quality.** No amount of writing skill compensates for thin source material.

### Research Categories Per Artifact

Each artifact documentation page covers six sections. Research must support all of them, but the bulk goes to Section 3 (producing quality work products). The research breaks into three categories:

#### Category A: V-Model Standards Research
**What:** What do DO-178C, ISO 26262, ASPICE, and IEC 62304 specifically require or recommend for this artifact type? Cross-standard comparison tables. Scaling by assurance level.

**Already done for:** Source code (`research/implementation/v-model-standards-implementation.md`), Unit tests (`research/implementation/v-model-standards-unit-testing.md`).

**Typical output:** One research document, 300-500 lines. Covers each standard's specific sections, then a cross-standard comparison.

#### Category B: Craft Best Practices Research
**What:** The professional engineering knowledge needed to produce a high-quality artifact of this type, independent of any V-model or safety standard. This is the equivalent of "Clean Code" for source code — the authoritative body of knowledge from recognized experts.

**This is the bulk of the research and the most commonly underestimated.** For each artifact type, identify:

1. **Foundational authors and works** — who are the recognized authorities? (e.g., for source code: Martin, Fowler, Beck, Meszaros, Freeman/Pryce. For requirements: Robertson, Wiegers, Hull/Jackson/Dick, Mavin for EARS.)
2. **Core principles and philosophy** — the "why" behind the practices, not just the "how"
3. **Patterns and anti-patterns** — with concrete examples, attributed to sources
4. **Quality metrics** — measurable indicators of quality for this artifact type
5. **Common mistakes** — what goes wrong in practice, with empirical data where available

**Expect 3-5 research documents per artifact type for this category.** The source code chapter needed: SOLID/clean code, architecture patterns, design patterns, AI-assisted development. The unit test chapter needs: test design philosophy, test doubles, test smells/maintainability, test organization, AI test quality.

**Typical output per document:** 300-600 lines. Specific claims attributed to specific sources with URLs.

#### Category C: AI-Specific Research
**What:** How does AI-assisted development specifically affect this artifact type? Empirical data on AI quality for this artifact. Common AI failure modes. Mitigation strategies.

**Typical output:** One research document, 200-400 lines. Must include quantitative data where available (2023-2025 studies preferred).

### Research Quality Bar

Each research document must meet these criteria:

- **Attributed claims.** Every factual claim cites a specific source. No "it is generally accepted that..." without a source.
- **Real sources.** Web-searchable, verifiable. Published books, peer-reviewed papers, recognized industry blogs (Fowler, Google Testing Blog), official standards documents. Never present LLM training knowledge as research.
- **Cross-referenced.** Where multiple sources address the same topic, note agreement or disagreement.
- **Practical examples.** Key concepts illustrated with concrete code or artifact examples.
- **Honest about gaps.** If a claim's provenance is questionable, say so (e.g., the IBM "100x cost" data).

### Procedure Steps

For each artifact documentation page:

```
1. IDENTIFY research needs
   - List the knowledge domains needed for Section 3 (quality workproduct)
   - Check what research already exists in research/
   - Gap analysis: what's covered vs. what's needed

2. RESEARCH (parallelizable)
   - Category A: V-model standards (if not already done)
   - Category B: Craft best practices (typically 3-5 parallel research efforts)
   - Category C: AI-specific concerns (1 research effort)
   - All research written to research/ directory

3. REVIEW research with human
   - Present findings summary
   - Identify gaps or areas needing deeper investigation
   - Get approval before proceeding to documentation

4. WRITE documentation
   - Section 3 first (the bulk — craft knowledge)
   - Sections 1-2 (intro and V-model context)
   - Section 4 (V-model considerations)
   - Section 5 (framework integration)
   - Section 6 (AI skills — stub until skills are built)

5. REVIEW documentation against source code chapter caliber
   - Is Section 3 organized by knowledge domains (not procedures)?
   - Does every principle have a concrete example (good and bad)?
   - Is the depth comparable to source-code.html?
   - Would this be useful to a human engineer with no AI agent context?
```

### Research Needs Per Upcoming Artifact (preliminary)

| SW Architecture (3.4) | Needed | ~3-4 (component decomposition, architecture styles, interface design, modularity/coupling metrics) | Needed |
| SW Requirements (3.5) | Partially done (EARS research exists) | ~3-4 (requirements engineering, EARS deep dive, testability/verifiability, requirements management) | Needed |
| System Requirements (3.6) | Needed | ~2-3 (system-level requirements, allocation, derived requirements) | Needed |
| System Test (3.7) | Needed | ~3-4 (system test strategy, test environment, acceptance criteria, regression strategy) | Needed |
| Review (3.8) | Needed | ~2-3 (review techniques, inspection process, review psychology) | Needed |

These estimates will be refined when each artifact's research phase begins.
