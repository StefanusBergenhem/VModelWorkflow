# Quality Bar gate — checklist + canonical check identifier catalog

Two purposes in one file:
1. Yes/No checklist the review skill walks. Every No → finding.
2. Canonical catalog of `check_failed` identifiers — stable name space for findings.

This file exceeds the ~100-line soft cap given the identifier density. The catalog tables are load-bearing — keeping them inline rather than splitting them preserves single-source-of-truth discipline. Exception accepted at landing.

## Contents

- [Quality Bar — Yes/No checklist](#quality-bar--yesno-checklist) — walk per sweep
- [Canonical `check_failed` identifier catalog](#canonical-check_failed-identifier-catalog) — IDs, severities, gating
- [Rule for new check identifiers](#rule-for-new-check-identifiers) — extension protocol

## Quality Bar — Yes/No checklist

### Structure

- [ ] All seven sections present (with explicit absence assertion on stateless State)
- [ ] Metadata has `parent_architecture` (HARD), `derived_from` (non-empty), `governing_adrs` where applicable
- [ ] Overview names what slice of the parent Architecture this leaf realises

### Function contracts

- [ ] Every public function has 9 contract elements (signature, preconditions, postconditions split, invariants, errors, nullability, side-effects, thread-safety, complexity-when-contractual)
- [ ] Postconditions have both `on_success` and `on_failure` branches
- [ ] Postconditions express result properties, not steps (HARD)
- [ ] Both halves stated where applicable (HARD)
- [ ] Numeric parameters carry units

### Data and invariants

- [ ] Every data structure: fields with invariants where type insufficient; ownership; lifetime
- [ ] Returned-object semantics stated when crossing public interface
- [ ] Shared mutable state names lock + happens-before + reader/writer

### Algorithms

- [ ] No code paraphrase (HARD)
- [ ] Algorithm contractual → named AND why-named
- [ ] Specification-pattern fits behaviour shape (decision table / state machine / sequence)

### State and concurrency

- [ ] Stateless leaf asserts absence in one line
- [ ] Stateful leaf has state inventory + transition table + undefined-event handling
- [ ] Thread-safety category named (per leaf and per shared field)
- [ ] Cancellation contract on long-running ops
- [ ] Timing constraints have all five elements

### Error handling

- [ ] Six questions answered per error class
- [ ] Five-column matrix populated
- [ ] Recovery strategy named per row (one of fail-fast / retry / fallback / compensate / propagate)
- [ ] Bounded retry budget (no unbounded retry)
- [ ] No "undefined" state-after-error

### Rationale and traceability

- [ ] Inline rationale on every non-obvious decision
- [ ] Constraint kind named (external / architectural / resource / temporal)
- [ ] No generic-principle invocation (soft greenfield; HARD retrofit)
- [ ] `governing_adrs:` resolves (HARD if dangling) and is body-cited
- [ ] Load-bearing + cross-cutting + hard-to-reverse decisions extracted to ADR
- [ ] No `[NEEDS-ADR: ...]` or `[NEEDS-TEST: ...]` stubs in finalised artifacts

### Retrofit honesty (retrofit only)

- [ ] `recovery_status: { overview: ... }` is `verified` or `unknown` only (HARD; schema enforces)
- [ ] Rationale fields `verified` or `unknown` only — never `reconstructed` (HARD)
- [ ] Every `reconstructed` field cites file/line/commit/schema evidence
- [ ] Every `unknown` paired with follow-up owner + action
- [ ] Gap Report populated (lost rationale, behavioural drift, missing ADRs, coverage gaps)
- [ ] No fabricated rationale (HARD)
- [ ] No laundered retrofit pattern (HARD)

### TestSpec traceability

- [ ] Every error-matrix row → test target ([ROBUSTNESS-TEST] or [NEEDS-TEST: ...])
- [ ] Every load-bearing postcondition → test target ([CONTRACT-TEST] or [ROBUSTNESS-TEST])
- [ ] Every load-bearing invariant → [PROPERTY-TEST] target

### Spec Ambiguity Test (meta-gate, override)

- [ ] Junior engineer can implement from this DD alone (with parent ARCH, governing ADRs, derived REQs)
- [ ] Test engineer can derive unit-test suite without seeing code
- [ ] Equivalent implementation in a different language satisfies the same DD

If any answer is No → DD fails regardless of other items.

## Rule for new check identifiers

1. Pick a stable dotted name in the appropriate namespace.
2. Add it to this catalog with severity and conditional gating.
3. Add the rule to the appropriate `*-checks.md`.
4. Add a Yes/No item if it is checklist-shaped.

Do not invent ad-hoc `check_failed` strings during a review.
