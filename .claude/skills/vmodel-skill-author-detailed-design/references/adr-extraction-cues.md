# ADR extraction cues (DD ↔ ADR seam)

DD applies decisions; ADR justifies cross-cutting load-bearing ones. Get the split right or rationale becomes invisible (under-extracted) or ADR sprawl (over-extracted).

## When to extract — the three conjunctive criteria

Extract a decision to an ADR when **all three** hold:

| # | Criterion | Test |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Load-bearing** | Other artifacts depend on it; removing it changes shape, not just code |
| 2 | **Cross-cutting** | Touches more than this leaf — multiple DDs, multiple Architectures, or future ones |
| 3 | **Hard-to-reverse** | Migration cost > making the decision again |

| Criteria satisfied | Right home |
|---|---|
| All three | ADR |
| Load-bearing + cross-cutting only (easy to reverse) | Could be ADR; team norm decides |
| Load-bearing + hard-to-reverse only (one scope) | Inline rationale in this DD |
| Cross-cutting + hard-to-reverse only (not load-bearing) | Inline; mention in `governing_adrs` if a sibling already covers it |
| One or zero | Inline rationale; do not promote |

## The `[NEEDS-ADR: ...]` stub

When DD authoring surfaces a decision meeting all three criteria, but the ADR is not yet authored → emit a stub at the spot the decision lands:

```text
[NEEDS-ADR: <one-sentence decision> — extract before finalising]
```

Example:

```text
[NEEDS-ADR: choose at-least-once vs exactly-once delivery for OrderPlaced events
            — extract before finalising]
```

The stub is a flag, not a placeholder for justification. The DD cannot be finalised until a sibling ADR exists, the ADR id is added to `governing_adrs:`, and the stub is replaced with the body-citation pattern (below).

## DD-vs-ADR — what each says

| ADR says | DD says |
|---|---|
| "OrderPlaced events delivered at-least-once" | "Idempotency key required on commit (per ADR-019); duplicate keys return the first response without re-commit" |
| "Postgres for transactional data" | "Order row + outbox row in single transaction (per ADR-019)" |
| "Tokens are bearer JWT validated at gateway" | "validate(token) trusts the gateway-validated subject claim (per ADR-008)" |

ADRs are referenced via `governing_adrs:` in front-matter, not inlined.

## Front-matter list pattern

```yaml
governing_adrs:
  - ADR-008    # bearer-JWT authn at gateway
  - ADR-019    # idempotency-key under at-least-once delivery
```

Comments after each id identify what the ADR covers. A reviewer should not need to open the ADR to know whether it is relevant to this DD.

## Inline body-citation pattern

At every spot in the body where a governing ADR's decision lands → cite it:

```text
postcondition: "Duplicate-key calls return the first response byte-for-byte
                and do not re-commit (per ADR-019)."
```

```text
recovery: "retry up to 2 times with exponential backoff (per ADR-019 —
           database write idempotency under at-least-once delivery)"
```

`governing_adrs:` list with no body citations → finding `check.adr.governing-not-cited-in-body`.

Body citation with no `governing_adrs:` entry → finding `check.adr.body-citation-unresolved`.

## How review checks this

Symmetric review skill verifies:

- Every `governing_adrs:` entry resolves to an actual ADR document
- Every ADR id in `governing_adrs:` appears at least once at a body citation point
- No `[NEEDS-ADR: ...]` stub remains in a finalised artifact
- No body text contains rationale obviously meeting all three extraction criteria but lacking an ADR reference (laundered inline rationale)

## Hard refusal

When the user pushes to inline a load-bearing + cross-cutting + hard-to-reverse decision because "we don't have time for an ADR" → do not inline rationale. Emit the `[NEEDS-ADR: ...]` stub. The DD cannot be finalised until the ADR exists.

Refusal example:

> User: "Just put the rationale for using HMAC-SHA256 over JWT in this DD — it's faster than writing an ADR."
>
> Skill: This is load-bearing (signature scheme; multiple validators depend on it), cross-cutting (used across all session-validating leaves), and hard-to-reverse (existing tokens would all become invalid). Emitting `[NEEDS-ADR: choose HMAC-SHA256 over JWT for session tokens — extract before finalising]`. The DD is incomplete until that ADR exists.
