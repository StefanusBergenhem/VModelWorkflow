# Quality Bar gate — checklist + canonical check identifier catalog

Two purposes in one file:
1. The Yes/No checklist that the review skill walks as Step 6 of orchestration. Every No is a finding.
2. The canonical catalog of `check_failed` identifiers used across the skill — the stable name space for findings.

## Quality Bar — Yes/No checklist

Walk every applicable item. Every No becomes a finding with the `check_failed` identifier listed in the catalog below.

### Vocabulary discipline

- [ ] Glossary section present and non-empty for non-trivial documents
- [ ] Every domain term used in a requirement statement is defined in the glossary
- [ ] One word per concept and one concept per word within this scope
- [ ] Generic placeholder terms (Manager, Service, Handler, Record, Processor) are audited out

### Requirement type clarity

- [ ] Every requirement is filed under the correct type section
- [ ] NFRs are in NFR form (not functional with an adjective); functional requirements are in functional form (not NFRs with smuggled behaviour)
- [ ] Level confusion has been audited — every requirement's scope matches this document's scope

### Statement-level quality

- [ ] Every statement is atomic (one `shall`, one behaviour)
- [ ] Every statement passes the box test (a tester can write the test from the statement and the glossary alone)
- [ ] Every statement is solution-free (no named technologies, frameworks, libraries, data structures, or algorithms — except externally imposed protocols in interface requirements)
- [ ] Every state-driven (`While …`) requirement is paired with its complementary out-of-state behaviour, or out-of-state is explicitly out of scope
- [ ] Structured language (EARS primary; GWT in `acceptance` blocks where useful) is used consistently rather than mixed within a statement

### NFR measurability — five-element rule

- [ ] Every NFR names the **system or subsystem** specifically
- [ ] Every NFR names the **response or behaviour** being measured
- [ ] Every NFR gives a **metric with unit**
- [ ] Every NFR gives a **target value** at the correct statistical level (percentile where applicable, not raw mean)
- [ ] Every NFR states the **condition** (load, environment, operating mode, measurement point)
- [ ] For tiered NFRs, the Planguage form (scale, meter, fail, goal, stretch, wish) is used rather than a single flat target

### Interface contract completeness

- [ ] Every interface requirement specifies protocol, message structure, timing, error handling, startup/initial state
- [ ] Pre/post-conditions and invariants are stated for each externally callable operation
- [ ] A versioning and deprecation policy is stated for every versioned interface
- [ ] Externally imposed protocols are cited by specification (RFC, OIDC version, draft) rather than informal name

### Constraints discipline

- [ ] Every inherited constraint cites its source
- [ ] Every inherited constraint names the cost of relaxing it
- [ ] Every inherited constraint is categorised
- [ ] Constraints with behavioural consequences have derived requirements authored and cross-linked

### Rationale — no fabrication

- [ ] Every requirement carries a `rationale` field with non-trivial content, OR explicit `pending`/`unknown` marker
- [ ] Rationale is captured at decision time (or marked `unknown` for retrofit when original reasoning is lost)
- [ ] Rationale in retrofit mode is marked `verified` or `unknown` only — **never** `reconstructed` (HARD REJECT)
- [ ] Rationales are audited for circularity (not "because test T passes") and laundering (not "because the current design is right")

### Traceability completeness

- [ ] Every requirement has non-empty `derived_from`
- [ ] Every derived requirement (those flagged `derivation: derived`) cites the introducing decision
- [ ] Every governing decision is referenced by at least one requirement or derived requirement

### Inspection discipline (informational)

- [ ] Document has been read from at least the Designer and Tester perspectives before delivery
- [ ] Where a stakeholder-facing outcome is at stake, the User/Stakeholder perspective has also been read

### Retrofit honesty (retrofit mode only)

- [ ] Behaviour fields are marked `verified` or `reconstructed`
- [ ] Rationale, open-alternatives, and intent fields are marked `verified` or `unknown` only
- [ ] Every `unknown` field has a follow-up owner and action queued
- [ ] `derived_from` links point to *observed evidence* (file:line, commit, log), not fabricated artifact names

### Spec Ambiguity Test (meta-gate)

- [ ] Could a junior engineer or mid-tier AI, reading only this document plus its glossary and governing decisions, derive a defensible architecture allocation, detailed design, and test specification — **without asking clarifying questions**?

If No, the document fails regardless of how many other items passed.

## Canonical `check_failed` identifier catalog

Stable identifiers used across all findings. Three namespaces:
- `check.<area>.<specific>` — structural / completeness checks
- `anti-pattern.<name>` — the 16 catalogued anti-patterns
- `design-issue.<specific>` — DESIGN_ISSUE triggers (problem is upstream)

## Rule for new check identifiers

When a check is added (e.g., a new anti-pattern is recognised, a new NFR element-presence sub-check is introduced):

1. Pick a stable dotted name in the appropriate namespace.
2. Add it to this catalog with severity.
3. Add the rule to the appropriate reference file (`*.md` in `references/`).
4. Add a row to the Quality Bar checklist above if it is a Yes/No item.

Do not invent ad-hoc `check_failed` strings during a review — every finding's identifier must appear in this catalog.
