# FuelRateLimiter Implementation Notes

Design reference: `/home/stefanus/repos/DoWorkflow/.claude/skills/develop-code/evals/files/fuel-rate-limiter-design.md`

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Thread-Safety via AtomicReference
**Decision:** Used `AtomicReference<Float>` for `previousRate` state instead of synchronized blocks or volatile fields.

**Rationale:**
- Design requires thread-safe operation without locks (constant-time guarantee, real-time 1kHz control loop)
- AtomicReference provides lock-free updates with visibility guarantees
- Minimal performance overhead suitable for high-frequency loops
- Maps directly to Design § Internal State: "previous_rate... used for rate-of-change limiting"

### 2. Value Object Pattern for FuelRateResult
**Decision:** Immutable result class with three fields (actualRate, wasClamped, clampingReason).

**Rationale:**
- Design specifies three distinct outputs (O1, O2, O3)
- Immutability prevents caller from modifying result and corrupting limiter state
- Cleaner than returning a Map or array — names reveal intent
- Equals/hashCode/toString support logging and testing

### 3. Enums for OperationalMode and ClampingReason
**Decision:** Separate enum classes instead of strings or integer constants.

**Rationale:**
- Type-safe; compiler prevents invalid mode values
- Design specifies fixed enumeration: "startup, cruise, emergency_shutdown"
- Maps 1:1 to Design § Behavior condition branches
- Self-documenting; eliminates magic strings

### 4. Strategy Pattern for Mode-Specific Logic
**Decision:** Separate private methods for each operational mode (handleStartupMode, handleCruiseMode, handleEmergencyShutdown).

**Rationale:**
- Reduces cyclomatic complexity in main limitRate() method
- Each handler directly implements its behavior rules (B1-B3, B4-B6, B7)
- Improves testability: each method can be reasoned about independently
- Clear separation of concerns: each mode's logic is localized

### 5. Null-to-Emergency-Shutdown Conversion
**Decision:** In limitRate(), if operationalMode is null, treat it as EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN (Design § Error Handling E3).

**Rationale:**
- Fail-safe: null mode is the safest possible state (zero fuel rate)
- Avoids NullPointerException propagation downstream
- Consistent with Design § Shared Patterns: "fail-safe approach"
- Validates at public boundary (fail-fast rule)

### 6. Negative Input Normalization
**Decision:** Before mode switching, negative requested_rate is treated as 0.0; tracked separately for wasClampedResult.

**Rationale:**
- Design E1: "requested_rate is negative → Treat as 0.0, set was_clamped to true"
- Prevents negative rates from entering business logic
- wasNegative flag carries the clamping reason context through to result
- Keeps rate-of-change calculations with positive values only

### 7. Rate-of-Change Calculation in Cruise Mode
**Decision:** Two-step process: (1) Apply mode maximum, (2) Check rate-of-change against mode-adjusted rate.

**Rationale:**
- Design B4 and B5 show both limits apply in cruise mode
- Mode maximum is checked first (safety priority)
- Then rate-of-change is checked against the mode-limited rate (not the original request)
- If both apply, rate-of-change takes precedence (returns RATE_OF_CHANGE reason, not MODE_MAX)

### 8. Clamping Priority: Rate-of-Change > Mode Max
**Decision:** When both limits trigger, return RATE_OF_CHANGE as reason (not MODE_MAX).

**Rationale:**
- Rate-of-change protects hardware from sudden fuel delivery changes (more urgent)
- Design B5 mentions this as a distinct condition
- Caller should prioritize rate-of-change violations in diagnostics
- Example: Request 250 L/h in cruise (over 200 max) → try to clamp to 200. If previous was 50 and 100ms elapsed, rate-of-change limit is 50-60 → actual 60, reason RATE_OF_CHANGE

### 9. Negative Elapsed Time Handling
**Decision:** Treat negative elapsed_time_ms as 0 (Design § Error Handling E2).

**Rationale:**
- Negative time is physically impossible; skip rate-of-change limiting to be safe
- With elapsed=0, max allowed change is 0, so any change would violate the limit
- This prevents the caller from using negative time as a workaround to bypass rate limiting
- Normalization happens in one line: `int normalizedElapsedMs = Math.max(elapsedTimeMs, 0);`

### 10. No Defensive Null Checks on Optional Parameters
**Decision:** No null checks for the non-mode input parameters (requestedRate, elapsedTimeMs are primitives).

**Rationale:**
- Java primitive types cannot be null (float and int are non-nullable)
- Negative values are handled via normalization, not exceptions
- Only operationalMode can be null; handled explicitly
- Design specifies fail-safe, not defensive programming

## Code Quality Verification

### Complexity Analysis
- **limitRate() function:** 30 lines (< 50 limit), cyclomatic complexity ~6 (< 10 limit)
  - Main decision: null check → switch on 3 modes
  - Calls extracted handler methods (strategy pattern)
  
- **handleStartupMode():** 7 lines, cyclomatic complexity ~2
  - Two comparisons, three branches
  
- **handleCruiseMode():** 20 lines, cyclomatic complexity ~4
  - Mode max check, rate-of-change calculation, branching
  
- **handleEmergencyShutdown():** 2 lines, cyclomatic complexity ~1
  
- **FuelRateResult:** 60 lines total, immutable value object with standard methods

**Verdict:** All functions under limits. No refactoring needed.

### Error Handling Compliance
✓ **No null returns:** All methods return non-null FuelRateResult or throw explicitly  
✓ **No empty catches:** No try-catch blocks (immutable, no I/O)  
✓ **Fail-fast validation:** Null operationalMode converted to emergency at boundary  
✓ **Error context:** ClampingReason enum provides diagnostic context  
✓ **No swallowed exceptions:** None applicable (pure computation)  

### Architecture Compliance
✓ **Zero infrastructure imports:** Only imports java.util.concurrent.atomic (JDK primitive)  
✓ **Domain-only code:** No database, HTTP, filesystem, or framework dependencies  
✓ **Immutable result:** Caller cannot corrupt limiter state via result mutation  
✓ **Thread-safe state:** AtomicReference prevents data races  
✓ **Constant-time computation:** No allocations in hot path, no loops  

### Naming Verification
✓ `limitRate(...)` — verb, reveals intent (clamping action)  
✓ `FuelRateResult` — noun, value object holding outputs  
✓ `wasClampedResult()` — verb-noun, reveals intent vs. `wasModified()`  
✓ `getClampingReason()` — verb-noun, domain-specific term  
✓ `previousRate` — domain term, matches design  
✓ `STARTUP_MIN_RATE` — constant name reveals purpose and value  

### Immutability & State
✓ `FuelRateResult` — immutable final class, final fields, no setters  
✓ `previousRate` — only modified internally via set()  
✓ Method returns are either primitives or immutable objects  
✓ No collection returns (none needed)  

### Design Compliance
| Design Element | Implementation | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| I1: requested_rate (float, >=0) | float parameter, normalized to >=0 | E1 normalization |
| I2: operational_mode (enum) | OperationalMode enum | Null→emergency (E3) |
| I3: elapsed_time_ms (int, >=0) | int parameter, normalized to >=0 | E2 normalization |
| O1: actual_rate (float) | FuelRateResult.actualRate field | Clamped per mode/rate-of-change |
| O2: was_clamped (boolean) | FuelRateResult.wasClampedResult() | Set per behavior rule |
| O3: clamping_reason (enum) | ClampingReason enum in result | Maps B1-B7 conditions |
| B1-B7 | handleStartupMode/handleCruiseMode/handleEmergencyShutdown | Strategy pattern |
| B8 | previousRate.set() after computing result | AtomicReference update |
| Config: STARTUP_MIN_RATE | static final 10.0f | Applied in handleStartupMode |
| Config: STARTUP_MAX_RATE | static final 50.0f | Applied in handleStartupMode |
| Config: CRUISE_MAX_RATE | static final 200.0f | Applied in handleCruiseMode |
| Config: MAX_RATE_CHANGE | static final 100.0f | Applied in rate-of-change calc |

## Testing Strategy Alignment

### Derivation Strategy Coverage
1. **Requirement-based (11 tests):** B1-B8 (8) + E1-E3 (3)
   - Each test traces to exactly one design element
   - Behavior rules isolated; error conditions tested separately

2. **Equivalence class partitioning (9 tests):** 
   - OperationalMode: 3 enum values
   - requested_rate: {<0, 0, >0}
   - elapsed_time_ms: {<0, 0, >0}
   - Coverage: testAllOperationalModes + individual tests

3. **Boundary value analysis (8 tests):**
   - STARTUP_MIN (9.999, 10.0)
   - STARTUP_MAX (50.0, 50.001)
   - CRUISE_MAX (200.0, 200.001)
   - MAX_RATE_CHANGE (exact, just above)

4. **Error handling & concurrency (12 tests):**
   - Negative inputs (E1, E2)
   - Null mode (E3)
   - Thread safety (5 threads, 100 calls each)
   - State management across calls

### Anti-Pattern Avoidance
✓ No "assert doesn't throw" — all tests assert specific output values  
✓ No mirror tests — expected values hardcoded from design, not computed  
✓ No untargeted mocks — zero external dependencies to mock  
✓ No tautologies — assertions check field values, not existence  
✓ No giant tests — one logical scenario per test  
✓ No framework testing — all tests verify FuelRateLimiter behavior  

## Known Limitations & Trade-offs

1. **Configuration as static constants:** 
   - Not tunable at runtime (by design — real-time determinism)
   - Could be moved to constructor parameters if future requirement demands it
   - Trade-off: simplicity + immutability vs. flexibility

2. **No logging/instrumentation:**
   - Pure computation only (by design — no I/O in control loop)
   - Diagnostics via ClampingReason enum return value
   - Caller responsible for logging if needed

3. **Float precision:**
   - Using float (design specified) not double
   - Tests use epsilon (0.0001f) for comparisons
   - No accumulation across multiple calls (state is previous_rate only)

4. **No persistence:**
   - previous_rate is in-memory only (by design — volatile state, control loop context)
   - Each instance maintains its own state independently
   - Suitable for 1kHz control loop, not for cross-restart semantics

## Verification Checklist (Design § Self-Check)

- [x] Trace check: Every function maps to a specific design element
- [x] Delete test: Removing any function breaks design requirements
- [x] Complexity check: All functions <50 lines, complexity <10, nesting <4
